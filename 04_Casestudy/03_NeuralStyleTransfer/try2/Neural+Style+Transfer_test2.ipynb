As seen below, it merges two images, namely, a \"content\" image (C) and a \"style\" image (S), to create a \"generated\" image (G). The generated image G combines the \"content\" of the image C with the \"style\" of image S. \n",

    "The Neural Style Transfer algorithm was due to Gatys et al. (2015). Harish Narayanan and Github user \"log0\" also have highly readable write-ups from which we drew inspiration. The pre-trained network used in this implementation is a VGG network, which is due to Simonyan and Zisserman (2015). Pre-trained weights were from the work of the MathConvNet team. \n",
